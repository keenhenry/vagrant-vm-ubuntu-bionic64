## vagrant-vm-ubuntu-bionic64

A Vagrant project for setting up Python Hahow development environment

### Setting up `vagrant` autocompletion ###

On my machine, here is what I did:

```bash
$ sudo cp /opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.3/gems/vagrant-2.2.3/contrib/bash/completion.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/vagrant.sh
$ . /etc/bash_completion
```

See [reference][1] for more details.
